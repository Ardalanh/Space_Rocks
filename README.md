+ Players ship has 3 abilities, which after each wave player can choose on to upgrade
  + Sheild( very orginal idea (^: )
  + Blink forward ( invulnerable during the blink animation )
  + Berzerk mode which means more fire rate and some regeneration

+ Enmeies have agro range to player, and their piorrity changes when they get hit from the player or the player gets near
  + They have one ability which they get to charge up their heavy weapon if player is really close, and fire many bullets
  + They follow the player for some seconds if player tries to run, then they turn back to their main target (the planet)
  + They surround the player and they don't bump to each other on doing so
